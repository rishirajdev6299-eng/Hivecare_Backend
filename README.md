# HiveCare Backend

HiveCare Backend is a secure RESTful API built with **Spring Boot** that powers the HiveCare home-service booking platform.

It provides backend services for customer authentication, role-based access, service management, worker management, booking operations, payments, reviews, profile management, reporting, and AI-assisted customer support.

```

## Project Structure

```text
src/
└── main/
    ├── java/
    │   └── com/
    │       └── hivecare/
    │           ├── controller/
    │           ├── service/

    │           └── util/
    │
    └── resources/
        └── application.properties
```

### Controller Layer

Handles incoming HTTP requests and exposes REST endpoints.

Examples include:

* User APIs
* Admin APIs
* Worker APIs
* Booking APIs
* Service APIs
* Payment APIs
* Review APIs
* Profile APIs
* Chat APIs

### Service Layer

Contains the application's business logic.

Responsibilities include:

* Authentication
* User management
* Booking processing
* Worker assignment
* Payment verification
* Service management
* Review processing
* Admin operations

### Repository Layer

Uses Spring Data JPA repositories for database operations.

Repositories handle:

* User data
* Booking data
* Service data
* Review data
* Database queries
* Entity persistence

### Model / Entity Layer

The backend contains entities representing the main HiveCare data.

Major entities include:

* User
* Service
* Booking
* Review

## Booking Status

The booking system supports multiple stages of a service request, including:

```text
PENDING
   ↓
ACCEPTED
   ↓
COMPLETED
```

Additional states such as rejection and cancellation are also supported by the booking workflow.

## Payment Status

Payments are tracked independently from booking status.

```text
PENDING
   ↓
PAID
```

The backend stores payment information such as:

* Payment Status
* Payment Method
* Payment Timing
* Razorpay Order ID
* Razorpay Payment ID
* Razorpay Signature
* Payment Date
* Completion Information

## User Roles

HiveCare supports three primary roles:

```text
USER
WORKER
ADMIN
```

The backend is responsible for determining and enforcing the user's role rather than relying only on frontend data.

### USER

Customers can:

* Browse services
* Create bookings
* View booking history
* Make payments
* Review completed services
* Manage their profile

### WORKER

Workers can:

* Manage availability
* View assigned bookings
* Accept bookings
* Reject bookings
* Complete services

### ADMIN

Administrators can:

* Manage users
* Manage workers
* Manage services
* Manage bookings
* Assign workers
* Monitor payments
* View analytics
* Manage reviews
* Generate reports

## Database

HiveCare uses **MySQL** with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.

The database stores information related to:

* Users
* Services
* Bookings
* Workers
* Reviews
* Payments
* Authentication and account security

The backend can also be configured to use a managed MySQL-compatible database for deployment.

## CORS

The backend supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow the React frontend to communicate with the Spring Boot API.

This allows HiveCare to work with:

* Local React development
* Deployed React frontend
* Desktop/Electron frontend
* Different frontend environments

## Frontend Integration

The backend provides REST APIs consumed by the HiveCare React frontend.

```text
HiveCare React Frontend
          │
          │ HTTP / REST
          ▼
HiveCare Spring Boot Backend
          │
          │ JPA / Hibernate
          ▼
       MySQL
```

## API Responsibilities

The backend is responsible for:

* Authentication
* Authorization
* User Management
* Worker Management
* Service Management
* Booking Management
* Payment Processing
* Payment Verification
* Reviews
* Reports
* Profile Management
* Support Chat
* Database Operations

## Deployment

The HiveCare backend can be deployed on cloud platforms that support Spring Boot applications and Docker.

The backend can be connected to a managed MySQL database such as **Aiven**.

Environment-specific configuration can be used for:

* Database credentials
* JWT secret
* JWT expiration
* Razorpay credentials
* OAuth credentials
* Gemini API credentials
* Frontend URLs
* CORS configuration

## Project Status

HiveCare Backend is an actively developed Spring Boot REST API supporting a complete home-service management platform.
